Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
I like the amount of CGI they used in this because it makes you feel like you're actually travelling in space.
This reminds me of the time I went to the planetarium at the Museum of Natural History. Looking at the vastness of space just amazes me.
The cartoon style fits nicely and is a nice alternative to the usual role-playing by actors in flashbacks.
This episode makes you realize how small humans are and how small our perception is. If we saw time as a whole, then how big are our problems? Does that one, 40-minute test really matter?
We've only existed in the last hour of the whole cosmic calendar. 
This makes me think of our self-caused worldwide problems of today, such as global warming and pollution. It feels like we messed up so much in so little time.v

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
In this episode they went deeper into the discoveries by humans relating to the cosmos, which is interesting.
I never knew there was so much controversy around Isaac Newton at his time. I didn't know he was a social recluse and that Robert Hooke accused him of stealing work.
Science is important because it gives logical explanations to the phenomena that we observe everyday.
By knowing, there is no reason to fear the wonders of the world. This is how knowledge conquers fear.
